## Inspiration
Everyone needs a personal webpage so that is why we decided to try our best at creating it.
There are a lot of website creators already such as WIX, or Web Flow. However, we were aiming to achieve the highest level of simplicity. No need to register, log in, nor subscribe. Just enter your personal info. 

## What it does
On load you are asked to enter various personal information to be displayed on your portfolio page.
you do that by writing in text fields and going forward using the button. 
As you complete all the fields, you are redirected to the next page that displays a message about your web page status. From there you can go head and. unravel your customized personal web portfolio. Others will be able to access your portfolio page by the URL you are redirected to.
On your web page you can find all the info you initially entered in the form. Buttons bellow the text description will guide you to separate pages - resume pdf, Github, and LinkedIn.

## How we built it
We split the work into Frontend and Backend. To built the Frontend, we used Java, Java Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To build the Backend we used Java, Java Spring Data, Java Persistence API and MySql. 

## Challenges we ran into
Most challenging part was learning and getting comfortable with the frameworks we used. 
We decided to use frameworks that were new to both of us and at the beginning it wasn't easy but we've learned a lot thanks to this project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Establish amazing teamwork, managing our time really efficiently, and learning new frameworks!

## What we learned
We learned a great deal about communication and teamwork. It was our first time working together, however, we had such a great time! We definitely know each other more now and are ready for new future challenges throughout the summer. 

## What's next for Portify
Hopefully we can improve the design and add even more functionalities for the user to create a perfect web portfolio, such as customized background color, font, font size, and so on.
